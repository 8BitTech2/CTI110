#  A backslash \ in a string acts as an escape character, such as with a newline \n.
# So, to print an actual backslash, escape that backslash by prepending another backslash.
# Ex: The following prints a single backslash: print('\\')
print()
# Draw a Cat
print('/\\   /\\')
print('  o o')
print(' =   =')
print('  --- ')
