'''
Nested loops - Print seats
Given num_rows and num_cols, print a list of all seats in a theater.
Rows are numbered, columns lettered, as in 1A or 3E.
Print a space after each seat.
      Sample output with inputs: 2 3
            1A 1B 1C 2A 2B 2C

# Note 1: You will need to declare more variables
# Note 2: Place end=' ' at the end of your print statement to separate seats by spaces
