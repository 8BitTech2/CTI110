# The FOR Loop
# Allows to create a mechanism that repeats a block of statements

for x in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]: # sequence of values is a "list" seperated by commas
        print(x) # list has 5 values so loop execuites 5 times
        
        
for x in [2, 4, 6, 8] # even numbers
        print (x)


for x in ['James', 'Chris', 'Jill', 'Cathy']:
    print(x)

for x in range(5) # generates a sequence of values
    print('Hello')


for x in range(1, 5): # starting value and Upper Limit
    print(x)

for x in range(1, 11, 2):   #Step value is 2
